# Problem

Given two binary strings, return their sum (also a binary string).

The input strings are both non-empty and contains only characters 1 or 0.

Example 1:

Input: a = "11", b = "1"  
Output: "100"  

Example 2:

Input: a = "1010", b = "1011"  
Output: "10101"

# Solution

## Idea

1. use built-in `bin()` function: convert binary to decimals, addition, then convert back into binary (very fast)

2. addition based directly on binary: a 2 or 3 carries 1, leaving behind 0 or 1 (slower, but still fast)

## Code

```python
class Solution:
    def addBinary(self, a, b):
        """
        :type a: str
        :type b: str
        :rtype: str
        """
        # one-line built-in method
        return bin(int(a, 2) + int(b, 2))[2:]
    
        # normal method
        a = list(a)
        b = list(b)
        sums = []
        carry = 0
        while a or b:
            s = 0
            if a: s += int(a.pop())
            if b: s += int(b.pop())
            s += carry
            if s == 0 or s == 1:
                sums.append(s)
                carry = 0
            elif s == 2:
                sums.append(0)
                carry = 1
            else:
                sums.append(1)
                carry = 1
        if carry: sums.append(carry)
        return ''.join([str(i) for i in reversed(sums)])
```
