# Problem

Implement `int sqrt(int x)`.

Compute and return the square root of x, where x is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer.

Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated and only the integer part of the result is returned.

Example:

Input: 8  
Output: 2

# Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def mySqrt(self, x):
        """
        :type x: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        left = 1
        right = x
        while left <= right:
            m = (left + right)//2
            if m**2 == x: return m
            if m**2 < x: left = m + 1
            else: right = m - 1
        return left - 1
```
