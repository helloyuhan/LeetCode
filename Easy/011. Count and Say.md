# Problem

The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers with the first five terms as following:

1. 1
2. 11
3. 21
4. 1211
5. 111221

1 is read off as "one 1" or 11.  
11 is read off as "two 1s" or 21.  
21 is read off as "one 2, then one 1" or 1211.

Given an integer n where 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, generate the nth term of the count-and-say sequence.

Note: Each term of the sequence of integers will be represented as a string.

Example 1:

Input: 1  
Output: "1"  

Example 2:

Input: 4  
Output: "1211"

# Solution

## Idea

Count the occurrence of each element and add the count and the element itself to the output string.

## Code

```python
class Solution:
    def countAndSay(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: str
        """
        seq = "1"
        for i in range(n-1):
            count = 0
            new = ""
            tmp = seq[0]
            for l in seq:
                if l == tmp: count += 1
                else:
                    new += str(count) + tmp
                    tmp = l
                    count = 1
            new += str(count) + tmp  # last set of values
            seq = new
        return seq
```
