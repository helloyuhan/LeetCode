# Problem

Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

Example:

Input: [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4],  
Output: 6  
Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.

If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle.

# Solution

## Idea

1. smart and simple method

accumulate element values from left to right until the sum becomes zero or negative; then repeat for the remaining of the list; maximum value is the final result

Time complexity: `O(N)` (go through the whole list)  
Space complexity: no extra space required

2. **divide-and-conquer** algorithm

The divide and conquer paradigm is often used to find the optimal solution of a problem. Its basic idea is to decompose a given problem into two or more similar, but simpler, subproblems, to solve them in turn, and to compose their solutions to solve the given problem. Problems of sufficient simplicity are solved directly. For exmaple: merge sort & binary search in a sorted list.

In this example, we calculate the maximum serial sum of left, right and cross-mid (sum of left and right) recursively, and find the maximum of all the max sums.

Time complexity: `O(Nlog(N))`

## Code

```python
class Solution:
	def maxSubArray(self, nums):
	    """
	    :type nums: List[int]
	    :rtype: int
	    """

	    # easy solution, O(N)
	    for i in range(1,len(nums)):
	        if nums[i-1] > 0:
	            nums[i] += nums[i-1]
	    return max(nums)




	    # divide-and-conquer algorithm, O(Nlog(N))
	    n = len(nums)
	    m = (n-1)//2
	    left_nums = nums[:m]
	    right_nums = nums[m+1:]
	    
	    # left max
	    sums = 0
	    left_sum = -1000
	    for i in range(m, -1, -1):
	        sums += nums[i]
	        if sums > left_sum:
	            left_sum = sums
	    
	    # right max
	    sums = 0
	    right_sum = -1000
	    for i in range(m+1, n):
	        sums += nums[i]
	        if sums > right_sum:
	            right_sum = sums
	    
	    crossMax = left_sum + right_sum
	    
	    return max(self.maxSubArray(left_nums), self.maxSubArray(right_nums), crossMax)
    
```
