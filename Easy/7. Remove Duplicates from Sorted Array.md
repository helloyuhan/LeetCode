# Problem

Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appear only once and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

Example 1:

Given nums = [1,1,2],

Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.

It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.

Example 2:

Given nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4],

Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being modified to 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.

It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.

# Solution

## Idea

Aprroach 1: delete duplicates

Approach 2: two pointers i and j, where there're values beyond the returned length

Time complexity `O(n)`

Space complexity: `O(1)`

## Code

```python
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """

        # delete duplicates
        if nums == []: return 0
        i = 0
        while i < len(nums) - 1:
            if nums[i] == nums[i+1]:
                del nums[i]
            else:
                i += 1
        return len(nums)

        # two pointers
        if nums == []: return 0
        i = 0
        j = 1
        for j in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] != nums[j]:
                i += 1
                nums[i] =  nums[j]
        return i+1
```
